# Virginia Tech Center for Ecosystem Forecasting Code of Conduct


We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience to everyone, including all center members, affiliates, and participants in center events. This code of conduct will be enforced as needed and applies to all VT-CEF members and affiliates; we note that this code supplements existing university and department policies, including the VT Principles of Community [https://www.vt.edu/principles-of-community.html]. This code was developed with the goal of affirming our center’s commitment to everyone’s growth and development, both personally and scientifically. This is a living document and we will revisit and update this document annually.

## Philosophy and Motivation

The philosophy of the VT-CEF is to create a harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone. We are committed to supporting and training people with different perspectives and backgrounds, which inherently makes our research, education, and engagement better. 

Safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by the day-to-day interactions we all have with each other. Thus, it is the responsibility of all members and affiliates of our center to help create and maintain a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment so that we may all benefit from it. Following the VT Principles of Community, we reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members and affiliates of our community in any form.

## General Guidelines
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other center members, affiliates, or contributors.

* Be an ally for your colleagues. Recognizing, intervening, and showing empathy for victims of discrimination is a critical way of supporting those around you, especially those with underrepresented identities.

* Create an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* The only way that we can have challenging discussions on challenging topics is to make the center a safe space for these conversations to happen. We start with the foundation that everyone in VT-CEF is inherently invested in supporting all center members and affiliates’ growth. To grow, it is important for everyone to be able to share their perspectives, and for others to provide feedback.

* Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you have no intent of harm. Listen when someone voices concern, reflect, take a growth mindset, avoid defensiveness, and commit to learning.

* Harassment and sexist, racist, discriminatory, or exclusionary actions, language, imagery, jokes, and microaggressions are unacceptable.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for all audiences, including people of many different backgrounds. 

All center members and affiliates are expected to abide by these policies at all work events, such as conferences, workshops, etc., as well as center-related social activities.

## Enforcement and Reporting Mechanisms

Anyone asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior is expected to comply immediately. If inappropriate behavior persists, the issue will be escalated according to VT policies; for more information, please see the VT Office for Civil Rights Compliance and Prevention Education (https://civilrights.vt.edu/) and Inclusive VT (https://www.inclusive.vt.edu). Failure to comply with this Code of Conduct could include losing VT-CEF affiliation/membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns about potential violations, please contact Cayelan or Quinn immediately. As all faculty, staff, and graduate teaching assistants are mandatory reporters, harassment violations of any kind have to be reported to the university’s Title IX office, which Cayelan/Quinn can help you navigate. The Title IX office can also refer you to other resources on campus if your concerns do not fit with their purview (e.g., the SAFE at VT program, https://safe.vt.edu). If Cayelan or Quinn is the cause of your concern, they need to be reported to the Title IX office as well. Following the established COI plan for CEF approved by the VT Board of Visitors, if there is a serious issue that arises between a CEF member with either Co-Director, concerns should be communicated to the Biological Sciences Department Head. Concerns can also be directed confidentially to the Virginia Tech Ombuds office (https://ombuds.vt.edu); there are separate Ombuds for students/staff/faculty at different career stages (e.g., for grad students, see: https://www.graduate.ombudsman.vt.edu/community.html). Other confidential resources include the Cook Counseling Center (https://ucc.vt.edu) and the Women's Center (https://www.womenscenter.vt.edu).
