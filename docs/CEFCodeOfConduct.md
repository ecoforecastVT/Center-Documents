# Virginia Tech Center for Ecosystem Forecsting Code of Conduct


We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience to everyone, including all group members and visitors. This code of conduct will be enforced as needed and applies to all Reservoir Group members; we note that this code supplements existing university and department policies, including the VT Principles of Community (https://www.inclusive.vt.edu/about/vtpoc.html). This code was developed with the goal of affirming our shared values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility and is grounded in our group’s commitment to everyone’s growth and development, both personally and scientifically. This is a living document and we will revisit and update this document annually.

## Philosophy and motivation

The philosophy of the Reservoir Group is to enable and support good science by creating a harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone. We are committed to supporting and training a diverse scientific workforce; our diversity is a strength and having multiple perspectives and backgrounds inherently makes our science better. 

Safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by the day-to-day interactions we all have with each other. Thus, it is the responsibility of all members of our group to help create and maintain a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment so that we may all benefit from it. Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), country or region of origin, political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, appearance, or body size will not be tolerated. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form.

## General Guidelines
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other group members or contributors.

* Be an ally for your colleagues. Recognizing, intervening, and showing empathy for victims of discrimination is a critical way of supporting those around you, especially those with underrepresented identities.

* Create an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* The only way that we can have challenging discussions on challenging topics is to make the lab a safe space for these conversations to happen. We start with the foundation that everyone in Reservoir Group is inherently invested in supporting all group members’ growth. To grow, it is important for everyone to be able to share their perspectives, and for others to provide feedback.

* Enter the conversation knowing we will inherently make mistakes, and that is okay so long as we learn from them. When/if a problematic statement or action is identified, take a growth mindset; try to avoid defensiveness and conflating the mistake with reflections on you as a person. 

* Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you have no intent of harm. Listen when someone voices concern, reflect, and offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

* Harassment and sexist, racist, discriminatory, or exclusionary language, imagery, jokes, and microaggressions are never appropriate.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a diverse audience, including people of many different backgrounds. 

All group members are expected to abide by these policies at all work events, such as conferences, workshops, etc., as well as lab-related social activities.

## Enforcement and Reporting Mechanisms

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Anyone asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior is expected to comply immediately. If inappropriate behavior persists, the issue will be escalated according to VT policies; for more information, please see the VT Office for Equity and Accessibility (https://oea.vt.edu) and VT Office of Inclusion and Diversity (https://www.inclusive.vt.edu).

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns about potential violations, please contact Cayelan or Maddy immediately. As all faculty, staff, and graduate students are mandatory reporters, harassment violations of any kind have to be reported to the university’s Title IX office, which Cayelan/Maddy can help you navigate. The Title IX office can also refer you to other resources on campus if your concerns do not fit with their purview (e.g., the SAFE at VT program, https://safe.vt.edu). If Cayelan or Maddy is the cause of your concern, they need to be reported to the Title IX office as well. Concerns can also be directed confidentially to the Virginia Tech Ombuds office (https://ombuds.vt.edu); there are separate Ombuds for students/staff/faculty at different career stages (e.g., for grad students, see: https://www.graduate.ombudsman.vt.edu/community.html). Other confidential resources include the Cook Counseling Center (https://ucc.vt.edu) and Women's Center (https://www.womenscenter.vt.edu).
