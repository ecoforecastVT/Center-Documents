# Virginia Tech Center for Ecosystem Forecasting Authorship Guidelines

## Aim
The aim of this document is to outline expectations for authorship on lab products (e.g., presentations, publications, EDI data products, etc.). Our goal is to be inclusive of all potential collaborators who have provided meaningful contributions, without whom the final product would not have been possible. We encourage product leads to discuss authorship early in the evolution of a project and continue to check in about authorship at project milestones (e.g., at the transition from data collection to analysis to writing). It is our expectation that the project lead and coauthors will work together to document their contributions – both at the initiation of and throughout a research activity that is expected to result in a product – in a formal authorship contribution statement. We hope this document will inspire discussion among our lab and coauthors throughout the project.

## Our Philosophy

Our philosophy is to be inclusive, transparent, and communicative about authorship throughout the development of lab products. To that end, these guidelines establish a framework for initiating communication about authorship when lab products are conceived, as well as guidelines to ensure ongoing communication about authorship throughout product development and publication. _Our focus here is specifically on center manuscripts and presentations that emerge from VT-CEF activities outside of funded project teams that have project-specific authorship guidelines. EDI data products are discussed separately below._

Our authorship policy is founded on three principles: 
1) Team members will be proactive in identifying expected manuscripts that are based on VT-CEF data and notifying team members who have contributed as data product leads over time, as well as others who have substantially contributed to the research activity, so that all interested individuals have an opportunity to participate; 
2) Upon initiation of a presentation or manuscript based on VT-CEF data, the lead author(s) will contact all lab members who have contributed to data collection or the research activity via e-mail to identify potential coauthors who wish to be actively involved in presentation or manuscript development (see more below); and 
3) Coauthors work with lead author(s) to track their contributions throughout the research activity, which will be documented in a formal authorship contribution statement in all manuscripts. Because presentations are usually developed early in the scientific process, coauthorship for that research activity may evolve over time and necessitates a new authorship discussion when the presentation becomes a manuscript.  

Below is a draft coauthorship invitation memo from the lead author(s) of a manuscript that is to be adapted as necessary and emailed at the beginning of a new research activity that is expected to lead to one or more manuscripts. Early notification of a research activity to the team ensures that all parties interested in coauthorship are identified early in the process of manuscript development and provided with information about: 
a)	what research is being conducted, 
b)	which team members are leading and/or already participating in the research, and
c) 	which team members have already contributed to the effort.


## What merits coauthorship?

We think that there are multiple ways in which a collaborator can make meaningful contributions, which may include (but are not limited to!)

* Project development
* Project infrastructure/funding support
* Data collection
* Laboratory analysis/sample processing
* Data/statistical analysis
* Developing figures
* Model/module generation
* Model calibration
* Data interpretation
* Writing

We do not necessarily consider data collection or lab analysis of samples to warrant coauthorship per se, without additional meaningful intellectual contribution to the overall project. For example, we do not consider the collection of field data or analysis of laboratory data by paid undergraduate assistants or research technicians to warrant coauthorship unless **independent** intellectual contributions are provided above and beyond the work they are being compensated for financially or with course credit. These intellectual contributions could include: e.g., developing new data collection protocols, initiating independent exploratory data analysis, creating new figures, writing new code, etc. 


## Undergraduate student/Research technician coauthorship
We realize that knowing what constitutes a meaningful contribution for coauthorship is challenging and may vary among projects/labs, so we encourage undergraduate assistants and research technicians to discuss these issues with their lab mentors at the beginning and throughout their time in the lab. Because many undergraduates may not know that authorship on a peer-reviewed product is a possibility or what the expectations for authorship may entail, it is especially important for their lab mentor and CCC to help guide those conversations as appropriate given the level of work that the student is completing in the lab. For example, the goal of conducting an undergraduate thesis in the lab is a publishable manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal, so it is important for thesis students and their lab mentor(s) to have ongoing discussions about manuscript development and authorship. We note that it is rare for most undergraduates to be coauthors on manuscripts because it usually requires multiple years of work from the time a project is initiated to when a paper is published.

In the case of undergraduate theses, the independent research contribution that is required to complete a thesis inherently merits coauthorship on products resulting from that work. In some cases, it may be appropriate for the lab mentor to be lead or corresponding author on a product after the undergraduate graduates, depending on the situation. Conversely, it is usually more challenging to identify if other research assistant activities in the lab (e.g., sample prep, data analysis) merit coauthorship. As noted above, we do not consider the collection or analysis of field and laboratory data by paid undergraduate assistants or research technicians to warrant coauthorship unless independent intellectual contributions are provided above and beyond the tasks they are assigned as part of their basic job description or course requirements. 

One important ethical requirement for being a coauthor is being able to describe and defend the research that went into the project. Consequently, we expect that any coauthor will remain engaged and contribute to the project until the product is completed. Most projects take multiple years to complete from data collection to publication in a peer-reviewed journal. As a result, authorship on intermediary products (e.g., oral presentations or posters at a conference) does not necessarily equate to coauthorship on final products (e.g., peer-reviewed publications). After an undergraduate student or technician leaves the lab, we expect that they will be responsive on email and provide up-to-date contact information to the primary author for projects that they are contributing to, as well as make sure that all data sheets, notebooks, files, etc. are digitized and properly archived with their lab mentor and CCC. A former student or technician must stay in contact with the lab post-graduation to be considered a coauthor on ongoing projects because they need to be able to approve the submission of any manuscript on which they are a coauthor. Thus, if a student loses contact with the lab, it is not ethically appropriate to list them as a coauthor.

## Graduate student/Postdoc coauthorship
We operate with the philosophy that lab members will provide general feedback on writing and talks, occasionally assist with field/lab work, etc. without the explicit expectation of authorship. Our philosophy is to be inclusive of authors and encourage graduate students and postdocs to talk with lab members early in the development of dissertation chapters and side projects about authorship. We encourage lab members to be reflective of their contributions and opt-in to being a coauthor on research products only when they realistically feel that they can make meaningful contributions. If a coauthor feels during a project that their contributions no longer merit coauthorship, we encourage them to initiate a conversation with the project lead about their status as a coauthor.
	
For graduate students and postdocs leading a project, it is important to reach out to coauthors early in the development of a product and initiate authorship discussions throughout the project’s evolution. As part of those conversations, we encourage graduate students and postdocs to acknowledge potential coauthors’ contributions to date as well as identify what explicit expectations need to be met for future coauthorship (e.g., substantive feedback on different aspects of the project, writing a specific section of a manuscript, etc.) which would be articulated in an authorship statement to accompany a manuscript. We encourage folks to draft an authorship statement early on in the process and update it as roles evolve during the project's duration. We recognize that this can sometimes be difficult when the project involves coauthors outside of the lab; we encourage you to reach out to CCC to discuss questions as they arise and use her as a resource! 

Far in advance of when a student/postdoc leaves the lab (e.g., multiple months beforehand), they need to meet with CCC to develop a plan for archiving datasets, code, samples, models, etc. they worked on as well as a plan for authorship/coauthorship on lab projects. The general expectation is that all lab datasets and their metadata will be archived and published via EDI, all shared project code archived on the lab github, any physical samples are quantified and properly archived (with a plan for how and when they will be disposed), and an up-to-date copy of all files affiliated with a product will be made available before a student/postdoc leaves (e.g., manuscript drafts, figures, and the code/data to reproduce any analyses/visualizations). At the time of leaving the lab, the student/postdoc and CCC will make an explicit plan for how to finish any ongoing lab projects. In the event a student is no longer willing or able to lead a lab product (e.g., moves onto a position where they are unable or do not want to lead a project to completion, is non-responsive to email for multiple weeks without providing any contact info), then CCC will become the default corresponding author to ensure that the lab product is completed. The overarching goal of this process is to ensure as smooth of a transition as possible and minimize the burden for current and future lab members, as well as future you!  

## EDI data products
Publishing data products is a new practice for most scientists. Our mandate as part of our NSF-supported Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology program is that the data we collect will be published with metadata to receive a DOI (digital object identifier) in the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository within a year of collection. Data publishing is now a requirement by many journals and funding agencies, and is a best practice for reproducible, open science. 

We recognize that there are many contributions to the collection, analysis, QA/QC, collation, and archiving of datasets. Similar to the description of what merits coauthorship on manuscripts, our philosophy is that coauthorship on data products requires independent, intellectual contributions to the dataset (see examples below).

For the lab’s core monitoring program data packages, the expectation is that the project PI (CCC)  will be the lead and corresponding author in recognition of the substantial contribution for maintaining and funding the continuity and integrity of EDI data products over time. In cases when a dataset is produced solely outside of the lab’s core monitoring program (e.g., as part of a Ph.D. dissertation chapter), authorship will be handled on a case-by-case basis, following the best practices outlined in this document.

Because of the substantial amount of work needed to archive data, we have developed a practice in which the VT-CEF member who is serving as the "data product lead" becomes the second author on that data product citation for that particular year's DOI revision. Here, we define a data product lead as the primary point person for a data package throughout a year. For some data products, there may be co-primary point people, which would be described in the authorship contribution statement.

The remaining author list includes the collaborators that contributed in other ways to the data product to merit coauthorship that year. To merit coauthorship, the collaborators need to contribute in at least two roles, which include (but are not limited to!): substantial fieldwork throughout the field season for the routine monitoring data collection (e.g., sampling at the reservoirs or preparing field gear most weeks in the summer and contributing in the fall/winter/spring as able); leading sensor/instrument maintenance/deployment; leading field crew; initiating new data streams and workflows; leading QA/QC; maintaining data workflows, including sensor connectivity; in-lab chemical or microscopic analyses; data analyses (including substantial digitization and processing); and publishing the data. 

The data product lead and collaborators will be updated every year. The one exception is when a dataset is first published, in which case all present and past data product leads and collaborators should be included as coauthors in that specific year.

An authorship contribution statement describing each coauthor’s contributions during that year will be included within the Notes section of the EDI data package, similar to authorship contribution statements on journal publications. As an example, “CCC developed and coordinated the monitoring program of these water quality variables. ABC led maintenance of instrument and data collection and was the point person for this dataset; ZYX led data QA/QC and substantially contributed to fieldwork." The previous years’ data product leads should be listed in the data package acknowledgements, which will be appended to over time.

These guidelines apply to all VT-CEF members (faculty, postdocs, technicians, graduate students, undergraduates) and emerged from iterative discussions within our group about data product authorship over several years. Because the practice of data publishing is rapidly changing, we plan to revisit and revise this section annually to enable these guidelines to evolve over time, supplemented by recurring conversations about authorship throughout the year.

TO: [Fill in relevant group members' names]

FROM: [Fill in lead author(s) names]
 
MANUSCRIPT TITLE: [Fill in tentative title and target journal] 

MANUSCRIPT TYPE: [Fill in manuscript type: e.g., graduate student thesis or dissertation; disciplinary research; interdisciplinary research; essay, concept, or commentary; data or methods; other (please describe)]

CURRENT COAUTHORS AND AUTHORSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS: [Fill in existing coauthor(s) names and existing authorship contributions]

I (We) are contacting you because you have been listed as a potential coauthor on the above manuscript that is associated with the VT-CEF. Below is a list of potential contributions by coauthors on manuscripts; the general expectation is that all coauthors have contributed in at least two ways to a manuscript. This list is intended to foster an open dialogue on authorship that starts at the very beginning phase of a manuscript and carries through until manuscript submission and acceptance. This document is intended to clearly define each coauthor’s responsibilities and accomplishments throughout the effort, as well as the overall strategy for determining coauthorship as described below. 

1.	If you are interested in being a coauthor on this manuscript, we ask that you describe in specific terms the ways that you will contribute to the manuscript. Some examples of manuscript contributions are listed below (note that this list is not exhaustive; please contact the lead author(s) if you would like to make contributions not included in the list). For each contribution, please be as specific as possible (e.g., instead of “collect data,” please specify what types of data will be collected, when, and how this data collection will occur). 
2.	Addition of coauthors. We recognize that in some cases it may be impossible to identify all coauthors at the beginning stages of a manuscript. In situations when an individual’s expertise is added to a manuscript in the middle of the manuscript development process, they should be added to the author list if their contributions satisfy the conditions described below.
3.	We encourage students and postdocs to talk with their mentors about the appropriateness of opting-in as a coauthor on project manuscripts.
4.	This list of potential contributions is not intended to be a checklist: we recognize that there are many different possible types of contributions to manuscripts throughout the initiation, development, analysis, and writing processes and that it is difficult to compare these contributions. Our goal is to be as inclusive and flexible as possible for each person who makes a substantive contribution to the manuscript. Here, we define a substantive contribution as a contribution in which the manuscript would not have been possible without it, or that it substantially enhances the breadth or quality of the manuscript. The specific contributions of each participant will be considered on a case-by-case basis and coauthorship status and order will be determined as the outcome of a discussion between manuscript lead(s), potential coauthors, and mentors.
5.	Once contributions are identified, the manuscript lead(s) and coauthors should work together to track their contributions (tasks and subtasks) to ensure transparency with the full research team and enable coordination of manuscript activities within the authorship team.
6.	Author ordering will be determined by the order of significance of contributions by each coauthor to the final manuscript. It will most often be the case that the manuscript lead(s) will be listed first, followed by coauthors in order of contribution and research mentor as last author. Where different contributions cannot be compared, an alphabetical listing of coauthors is the recommended practice.
7.	In general, data provision alone (e.g., if you have contributed as a dataset's point person) is not assumed a priori to warrant coauthorship. We expect leaders of manuscripts based on lab data products to contact that dataset's historical point people (for the relevant years of the analysis) as potential coauthors, even if those point people are no longer in the lab. If any dataset point person/data provider expresses an interest in coauthorship, it is the responsibility of the manuscript lead(s) to meet with that person to identify what other contributions justify coauthorship. 
8.	All coauthors must approve the final version of the manuscript prior to submission. It is unethical to submit a manuscript in which all coauthors did not read and approve the final submitted version. This task is not included in the contributions list below because all coauthors must do it. Moreover, all coauthors must stay in contact with the manuscript lead(s) throughout the drafting and submission process. If a coauthor no longer remains in contact to approve the manuscript, they cannot ethically be kept as coauthors on the submitted version. 
9.	Coauthors are held accountable for the content of the manuscript. This idea provides an important distinction between a coauthor and someone who is listed in the acknowledgements. We recognize that every coauthor will not have full knowledge of all aspects of the research; however, they need to know enough to defend the work.
10.	An authorship contribution paragraph is to be included for each manuscript, as required by many journals. This step is important to ensure that all coauthors (particularly early-career team members) are recognized for their contributions. If some journals don’t automatically require these statements, we recommend adding it to the Acknowledgements section in the manuscript.

Examples of Potential Coauthor Contributions
Potential coauthor contributions identified here are a starting point for team members to think about whether their contributions to a manuscript rise to the level of coauthorship. This is by no means an exhaustive list of ways in which coauthors may contribute, and not all of these contributions may warrant coauthorship. As the project evolves and different types of manuscripts are created, the contributions made by potential coauthors are likely to vary significantly and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Examples of Concept and Design Contributions
1.	Conceived or contributed to the conception of a manuscript idea/overarching topic such that input helped define the fundamental contribution of the manuscript
2.	Designed/outlined the manuscript
3.	Contributed to the conceptual/theoretical framework for the manuscript
4.	Supervised and/or co-supervised authors and manuscript progress
5.	Provided platform for research to occur (e.g., facilitated interactions with water utility, received funding that enabled research, created infrastructure that enabled research interactions to occur, etc.)

Examples of Research Contributions
1.	Contributed to data collection in a substantive way (e.g., served as dataset point person for at least one year of the analysis)
2.	Oversaw or led quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) of data
3.	Developed or calibrated models or a part of a model
4.	Contributed new analyses or methods
5.	Interpreted results or placed results in a context to enhance the greater contributions of the analysis

Examples of Writing Contributions
1.	Wrote sections of text, even if the text was not retained in the final manuscript version 
2.	Designed figures and tables
3.	Performed critical reviews or substantial re-working of manuscript

Other
We welcome additional contributions and encourage a potential coauthor to discuss other contributions with the lead author(s).
