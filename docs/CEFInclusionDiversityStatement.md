# Virginia Tech Center for Ecosystem Forecasting Inclusion and Diversity Statement

We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience to everyone. This statement was developed to affirm our shared values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility and is grounded in our centers’s commitment to everyone’s personal and scientific growth and development. This is a living document that we will revisit and update annually at the beginning of the fall semester.

Safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by both 1) day-to-day interactions we all have with each other and 2) ensuring that DEI is embedded in the center’s longer-term strategic decisions. It is the responsibility of all members of our center to work together to create and maintain a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment for all.

## Action Plan

We are actively working to promote greater inclusivity in our center, our communities, and our disciplines by:

* Holding each other accountable to a center code of conduct: we co-created the VT-CEF code (updated by the center annually) to ensure everyone has a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience in our community

* Developing inclusive practices for: our community interactions (via our code of conduct); recruiting and mentoring team members; and safely conducting fieldwork

* Conducting translational science: we work closely with managers and community members to co-develop forecasts and conduct research to ensure that our findings are usable and accessible to the communities we live in

* Communicating our science: we partner with educators, outreach coordinators, and managers to translate our research, solicit feedback, and ensure that our findings are broadly shared and accessible to the public

* Promoting best practices of open science: to enable greater participation in ecosystem forecasting, we use and develop open-source software, publish all of our data shortly after collection, and are constantly evolving center practices to ensure accessibility and reproducibility of our data and analyses

* Teaching as research: we develop, assess, and disseminate hands-on, active learning teaching materials, which reduce the achievement gap of students in STEM. We use assessment data to constantly revise our teaching modules and methods to improve their accessibility for a wide range of students
