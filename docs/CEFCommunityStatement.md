# Virginia Tech Center for Ecosystem Forecasting Community Statement

We are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience to everyone. This statement was developed with the goal of affirming our center’s commitment to everyone’s personal and scientific growth and development. This is a living document that we will revisit and update annually.

Safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environments don’t just happen: they are created by both 1) day-to-day interactions we all have with each other and 2) ensuring that our commitment to these principles is embedded in the center’s longer-term strategic decisions. It is the responsibility of all members of our group to work together to create and maintain a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free environment for all.

## Action Plan

We are actively working to promote greater inclusivity in our center, our communities, and our disciplines by:

* Holding each other accountable to a center code of conduct: we co-created the VT-CEF code (updated by the center annually) to ensure everyone has a safe, inclusive, accessible, and harassment-free experience in our community

* Developing inclusive practices for: our community interactions (via our code of conduct); recruiting and mentoring team members; and safely conducting fieldwork, workshops, and trainings 

* Conducting ethical, translational science: we work closely with managers and community members to co-develop forecasts and conduct research to ensure that data sovereignty is respected and our findings are usable and accessible to the communities impacted by our work

* Communicating our science: we partner with educators, outreach coordinators, managers, and other community members to translate our research, solicit feedback, and ensure that our findings are understandable, broadly shared, and accessible to the public

* Promoting open science: to enable greater participation in ecosystem forecasting, we use and develop open-source software, publish all of our data shortly after collection, and are constantly evolving center practices to ensure accessibility and reproducibility of our data and analyses

* Teaching as research: we develop, assess, and disseminate hands-on, active learning teaching materials to enhance STEM education. We use data to constantly revise our teaching modules, tutorials, and methods to improve their effectiveness
